# Backend

The backend of Ohana is run on Ruby on Rails and the site is hosted on Heroku. The backend part of the application responds to api server requests and responds with JSON objects. 

## Database

PostgreSQL was used for the backend database. 

## Dependencies

Much of the site's front end components were imported from semantic-ui-react, a React integration for the Semantic-Ui library. The rest of the project's major dependencies are listed below: 

   
- FileStack for image attachment, processing, and hosting 
- BCrypt for password-salting and hashing for user authentication 
- Semantic-Ui-React for component styling 
- react-chatview for rendering feed/chat components with infinite scrolling
